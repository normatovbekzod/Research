Welcome to the Unified Transform Lab for Summer 2022!

### Dates & payment
Thanks for giving me your start & end dates. If there are any changes, please let me know as early as possible. If you are not being paid by CIPE directly, then you will have to file timesheets etc through NSWS. For help with that system, please read the guides or contact CIPE.

### Getting started
Please carefully read

* The rest of this email
* README.md in your repository
* CONTRIBUTING.md in your repository
* JUPYTERHUB.md in your repository if you want to use the Unified Transform Lab's jupyterhub server.

### Project management
With any major project, it is important to use some system for project management. We will use GitLab's repository, issues, milestones & labels systems. You should have already received an invitation to the GitLab project for your research. Before you do anything else, you should carefully read the file CONTRIBUTING.md in the root of the repository. It explains how we will use GitLab's issues etc for project management. Then have a look at the GitLab issues and milestones already in your project for instructions on what to do next.

Any questions? Create an issue and we'll discuss it!

If you have not yet completed the Yale-NUS College module Proof, then please read [progit](refs/progit.pdf) on how to use git. You should have git set up on your own computer and you should become comfortable using it. While working on your research, don't be afraid to take your git use to the next level by trying a different gui or making more use of the command line.

You also need to get used to LaTeX, for which I recommend reading the tutorials at [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com). You should install a modern text editor on your computer, such as Atom (macOS/Linux/Windows), VSCodium/VSCode (macOS/Linux/Windows), or Notepad++ (Windows only), and use it for LaTeX. If you have not yet done this, please contact Dave for help with setting it up.

### Meetings
If we can't meet in person this summer, we will to meet over video conferencing. We'll use Zoom. We'll try to follow the advice at https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/ to improve efficiency of these meetings.

You and Dave will meet at least once each week to discuss progress. During these meetings, we can review the last week's achievements, work on mathematical & computational problem solving, and plan tasks for the week ahead. We can have more meetings than just one per week, but it would be more efficient to use GitLab's issues to discuss approaches as much as possible, so we'll try that before calling an extraordinary meeting.

We will also have several meetings over the summer with everyone present. Your time won't be wasted with loads of these meetings, but it is valuable for you to all know how your projects fit together into the larger research programme for the Unified Transform Lab, and what expertise each of us has and is developing.

Sometimes, it might be valuable for you to meet with someone else in the lab to share expertise, with or without Dave. Please do so, and also invite other lab members to be Reporters in your GitLab project if they need to see your work.

### CIPE training
If you are funded through CIPE, then it is very important that you participate in all the training events CIPE organises. If you are not funded through CIPE and have not participated in this training in a previous summer, then you are strongly encouraged to seek out this training by contacting the coordinator of the summer research programme. Please look out for emails from the coordinator of the summer research programme, and make sure you respond accordingly.

### Reports
We have a public website for the [Unified Transform Lab](https://www.unifiedtransformlab.com/). Please [write a little about yourself](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYeeD3lawCIJVKHvpz5DD4-Cgq4AanVVM2X_eZyD0WQWY12w/viewform?usp=sf_link) for the website.

You must produce a final written report on your research, using LaTeX. You must prepare a short presentation with associated LaTeX poster or slide deck. Depending on your research aims, you may also be expected to produce a julia package or a collection of julia scripts, unit tests etc. These will be due at the completion of the project, and may be published in whole or in part on the Unified Transform Lab website and/or a public repository.

You may be asked for one or more interim reports upon reaching project milestones. These are internal reports, not designed for wider publication.

Continuous, fastidious use of GitLab issues and commit messages, as described in CONTRIBUTING.md, will make it easier to write these reports, when the time comes to do so. Remember to keep the issue tracker and commits in sync, and reference specific commits in the issue discussions.

### Jupyterhub
You have access to the Unified Transform Lab's jupyterhub at https://jh.dasmithmaths.com. You are welcome to make use of it and/or your own julia installation. You can find instructions in JUPYTERHUB.md, in your repository. You will get an email with your username and initial password.

### Questions & clarifications
If you have questions or clarifications, please don't hesitate to email Dave, or file an issue in GitLab.
